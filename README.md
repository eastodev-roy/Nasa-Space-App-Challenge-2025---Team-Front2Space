# 🦈 Sharks from Space  
*A NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025 Project*  

---

## 🌍 Overview  
**Sharks from Space** leverages **NASA satellite data** and **AI models** to predict shark foraging hotspots across the oceans.  
Our goal is to **bridge space and marine conservation** — helping researchers, policymakers, and the public understand shark activity and its relationship with environmental changes.

## 🚀 Features  
- 📡 **Satellite Data Integration** – Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Chlorophyll, Sea Height, and more.  
- 🤖 **AI Predictions** – Machine learning models that predict shark foraging zones.  
- 🗺️ **Interactive Map** – View hotspots, toggle environmental layers, and explore predictions.  
- 📊 **Data Insights** – Charts showing correlation between shark presence & environmental factors.  
- 📱 **Mobile App (Flutter)** – Easy-to-use app for public awareness and conservation.  
- 🌍 **Educational Hub** – Learn about sharks, oceans, and how space data helps.
